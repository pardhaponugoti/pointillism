Welcome to pointillism.  This is a site where you can watch famous art created through
the technique of pointillism.  Click on the page to start, and click to change paintings.

It should take about 30 seconds for the painting to start truly resembling the original,
so please have some patience.

Enjoy!

## How It Works

The program loads an image randomly, and resizes it to the size of the screen.  It chooses
a random coordinate on the image and gets the pixel color value.  It then adds a circle to the canvas
of a random size, and the larger the circle is, the more transparent is.  As time goes on,
the range of sizes of the points decreases.
