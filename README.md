Welcome to pointillism.  This is a site where you can watch famous art created through
the technique of pointillism.  Click on the page to start, and click to change paintings.

It should take about 30 seconds for the painting to start truly resembling the original,
so please have some patience.

Enjoy!

a random coordinate on the image and gets the pixel color value.
